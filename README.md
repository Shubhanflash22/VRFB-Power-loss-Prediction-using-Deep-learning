# Optimization of Renewable Energy Storage

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning (Jan 2023 – May 2023)

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of predicting power loss in renewable energy storage systems by applying machine learning and deep learning models to battery parameters such as state of charge and electrolyte flow rate.

## Overview

The goal was to optimize energy storage performance and reduce operational cost by developing data-driven prediction models for power loss in Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs).

## Work Done

* **Developed three models — ANN, LSTM, and RNN** — to predict power loss at various states of charge (SOC) and electrolyte flow rates.
* Designed a pipeline for **data preparation, feature engineering, and sequential modeling** tailored for time-dependent electrochemical behavior.
* **Compared performance** against existing baseline models used in the lab.
* **Achieved a 40–70% improvement in prediction accuracy**, with each of the three models outperforming traditional approaches.

## Result

A set of deep learning–based predictive models that significantly enhance the accuracy of power-loss predictions, enabling better optimization of VRFB energy storage systems and lowering operational costs.
